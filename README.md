## Goal

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a method that allows the use of an optical fibre as an array of discrete sensors. Its implementation in already placed optical fibres for telecommunications can be useful for monitoring vibrations in structures and detection of earthquakes, among other things. In this work, a particular application is studied where an optical fibre is placed below a highway, and it is used for estimating the velocity of vehicles. A so called Deconvolutional Autoencoder is used to process the measured signals for a better estimation of the vehiclesâ€™ velocity.

**In this project**, the Deconvolutional Autoencoder is retrained with the data consisting on the vibrations caused by vehicles on a highway to compare the results given in the original work. This implementation is compared with a classic minimisation algorithm for deconvolution called FISTA. Once the Deconvolutional Autoencoder is trained with the original data, it is adapted to new data by changing the activaction function of the output layer and the convolution method used for feedback. **This is done as a proof-of-concept, to test if is possible to use the DAE to process data measure on a fiber from a linear frequency chirp, in order to sense the characteristics of a certain terrain.**

The DAE is based on the work of

## Results
![results](Figuras/Figura1.png)

When applying the DAE to the new data we could observe that the architecture used by the authors of the network performs a cross-decorrelation instead of a deconvolution, by not inverting the kernel in the feedback. This error is due to the fact that machine learning libraries often use interchangeably the term convolution applied to cross-correlation and convolution. By using the correct kernel inversion, an improvement in convergence is obtained. convergence improvement is obtained.
